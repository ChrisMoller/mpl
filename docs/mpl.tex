{\bigsl APL} has been around for ages and back when the input method was a
modified IBM Selectric typewriter with a custom type ball, it was cool.  But I
always found it to be a Royal Pain$^{{\rm TM}}$ remembering the
finger-tangling combination of ctrl-, shift-, and alt- keys needed on modern
keyboards to get dominoes, quotequads, and whatnot.
